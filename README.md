# spring-boot-starter-tcserver-example
Example usage of spring-boot-starter-tcserver

This project is a simple example of how to use spring-boot-starter-tcserver as a drop in replacement for spring-boot-starter-tomcat.  

Currently spring-boot-starter-tcserver version 0.1.RELEASE only provides a drop in replacement for spring-boot-starter-tomcat. Additional functionality will be added in the next release.

Prerequisites
=============
To use this example you will need

* Register for free access to Pivotal Commercial Maven Repository - https://repository.cloudfoundry.com/
* JRE/JDK 7 or newer
* Maven 3.2 or newer (Required by spring-boot-maven-plugin)

Maven Usage
==================

You will need the following configured in your ~/.m2/settings.xml. Username and password should be the same as used on the Pivotal Commercial Maven Repository

```xml
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>tcruntime-release</id>
			<username>*your email*</username>
			<password>*your password*</password>
		</server>
		<server>
			<id>spring-boot-starter-tcserver-release</id>
			<username>*your email*</username>
			<password>*your password*</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
```

Once configured you can run the example via maven.

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively you may specify the port to bind to via the server.port property
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8081
```

This example runs a simple web app with the Embedded tc Runtime version as the content.

You can use curl to verify

```
curl localhost:8080
```

Gradle usage
============

For gradle usage example please see build.gradle

Troubleshooting
===============

* "Tomcat connector in failed state" - This generally means that there is a port conflict. By default this example tries to bind to port 8080.
